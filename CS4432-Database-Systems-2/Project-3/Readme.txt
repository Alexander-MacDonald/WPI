SECTION 1: Compilation & Execution Instructions
Compile inline:
    1. javac Main.java
    2. java Main

Example commands used for testing can be found in "exampleCmds.txt"

SECTION 2: Test Cases

As far as I can tell there are no issues with this program from my testing and the rubric provided.

SECTION 3: Design Decisions Beyond Specs

I changed the format of the hashtable in section 3 to be more accessible for future implementations with:
Name -> {Sum, Count} to easily calculate the aggregate functions.

Otherwise, I did my best to match specs.
